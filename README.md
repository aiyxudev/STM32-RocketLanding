successfully on the launch pad. Every player starts with 3 lives to past 3 levels,press c on nunchuck \
to start the game. you can turn spaceship 
counterclockwise by moving the nunchuck to the left or clockwise by moving the nunchuck to \
the right. And you can trigger the thrust by pressing z button of nunchuck. Thrusting visual \
will be display at the bottom of the spaceship and sound will be played.To pass the current level, \
player need to land spaceship face upward (with 20 degree of allowance) on the red launchpad. If the \
spaceship landed successfully, LED lights will spark for congradulation and move on to the next level.\
If the spaceship crashes on the obscales or landed incorrectly, it will explode and corresponding image\
and sound will come up. After player lost all 3 lives, the game is over. The current level the players at \
