q1)Describe each of the tasks that you were responsible for performing and
how each contributed to the overall project.

I am mainly responsible for the sound effect. The sound effect give more dimension 
for the game and increase the gaming experience. And convert image file to rgb using 
file system to ensure it can display on the board disregarding if STM32 board react to SD card. 


q2)What technical challenges did you encounter in completing your tasks? 

The most difficult technical challenge I had is with the audio file. A lot of file size of 
wav files I donwloaded is way too big. I adjusted the sample rate and bitrate using sox command 
to match with "thermo.wav" file. Even though while running the game I still constantly getting 
rc = 9 error message, at least I can get it to play.

The same problem also exist for image display as well. We try to use read image from sd card, 
however, since the STM32 is really sensitive and it mostly ends up with rc=3. Therefore, I implement 
file system to place image as rgb format.


q3)What would you do differently if you could start the project over?

I will first make sure the video file can be played 
I wish we can record player's scores using how much time they need to finish the level,the quicker you finish 
the higher score you will get.
